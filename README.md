# Mathworks-Mathematical-Modeling-2018

For the 2018 Mathworks Mathematical Modeling Challenge, we had to determine whether repurposing wasted food in Texas can feed all of 
the its food insecure population.

Our strategy was to treat each county's recovered food as a resource which is first shared to the county's food insecure population.
We then find the total decificent or excess food in each county. Then we use a greedy algorithm to find the cost of shipping food between 
counties in order for them to feed all the food insecure population of Texas. 
The detail can be found in our [Paper](https://github.com/DumboOctopus/Mathworks-Mathematical-Modeling-2018/blob/master/PAPER.pdf).

We found that all of the food insecure population could be feed for under 7 million dollars, which is a reasonable sum for a state government.
